# This a fun list of people acting like clowns

## 1. S1MXN (Simon)
This user goes by S1MXN on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@S1MXN) and s1mxnyt (285913424716627970) on discord.

He made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQk5OGRqzQ8) on August 1st and claimed the tool is his within this video. He then goes on to double down in the comments that the tool is his.

In this example he even claims to want to take down other peoples videos for copying his work:

Here are a few other funny images of him claiming that he is fixing the tool (as this version of the tool stopped working after an xbox app update)

He finally spoke to me on discord which resulted in this great interaction where he claims that I actually stole his work and even that I hacked him to upload the code before his video.

I first pretty innocently ask about the tool as a concerned user as it has stopped working

I then link this github repo and ask if the code was stolen from him

He responds to my surprise with yes

I then ask him how the code managed to get there before his video and if his PC was hacked and he once again responds to my surprise with yes

## 2. relights
This user goes by relights/em on discord (761088676675321856)

This user first linked the S1MXN video claiming it was the "only legit tool"
![image](https://github.com/ItsLogic/Xbox-Achievement-Unlocker/assets/38233332/dbee43ad-0853-460b-b7db-6d06566a6e6b)

They then claim to have made the tool themselves

When called out they double down

I then replied to this message with the file hashes proving they did not edit anything and its just a direct rip

The interaction ends with them repeating the same stuff
